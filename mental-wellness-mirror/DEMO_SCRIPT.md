## üôã Q&A Preparation

### Common Questions:

**Q: "How accurate is the emotional analysis?"**
**A:** "GPT-4 is trained on vast psychological data and provides general emotional insights. While it's not a replacement for professional therapy, it's excellent for self-reflection and pattern recognition."

**Q: "What about privacy?"**
**A:** "Great question! All data is stored in your own MongoDB instance. In production, we'd add encryption, user authentication, and GDPR compliance. Users would own their data."

**Q: "How much does it cost to run?"**
**A:** "OpenAI API costs are minimal‚Äîabout $0.01-0.03 per text entry and $0.006 per minute of audio. For a personal app, that's under $5/month."

**Q: "Why voice AND text?"**
**A:** "People express emotions differently. Some prefer writing, others prefer speaking. Voice is especially useful while driving, exercising, or when emotional‚Äîtalking feels more natural."

**Q: "Can you add more features?"**
**A:** "Absolutely! The architecture is modular. We can easily add features like mood filters, export to PDF, calendar integration, or even real-time emotion detection."

**Q: "How long did this take?"**
**A:** "We built this during the hackathon‚Äîroughly [X hours/days]. The rapid development was possible thanks to modern tools like Vite, Tailwind, and OpenAI's excellent APIs."
